This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating two common yet often overlooked runtime exceptions: ArithmeticException (division by zero) and NullPointerException (accessing members of a null object). The code includes example exception handling, but it also deliberately leaves one exception unhandled to highlight the potential for unexpected program termination. The solution demonstrates how to handle these exceptions more robustly.
